The purpose of this repository is to develop a testcase which will check that the Spring framework bundles
resolve inside an OSGi container.

Pre-req's
=========

Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 was used for building. This should be installed as documented here: http://www.gradle.org/installation

Building
========

gradle clean test

Using Eclipse
=============

Since Gradle generates Eclipse .classpath files which contain absolute paths on the user's machine, these are not checked in.
You should generate your own:

gradle eclipse
